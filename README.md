Burnt District is a salon and spa located in Seattle's Pioneer Square. The goal is to update the clunky Wordpress site I made to a sexy one-page app.
Will be using some animation, javascript, and if I am feeling rambunktious(spelling?), I i'll throw in some ajax just for the practice althogh there is no real reason for it as it is a static page.
