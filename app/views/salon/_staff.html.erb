A few experimental colors and box cutter razor cuts later, she found herself absorbed in being able to transform her friends and family into a piece of art. Fleeing the Southwest, she landed in Seattle to train with the experts at Gene Juarez and worked with them for two years. She now sculpts hair by day and keeps up with Seattle's music scene by night with her band, Stations.
